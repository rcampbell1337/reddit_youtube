# Youtube Video Generator
A bit of a fun project here, creates youtube videos by scraping the top comments from Reddit then merging them with a random background video and a tts library. Really quite cool and 
merges alot of stuff together, however one annoying limitation is that the actual publishing of videos is marked as spam immediately by youtube, still very cool.
